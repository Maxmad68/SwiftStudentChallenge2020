**To be short**: The Shepherd Game is a mini-game where you are a shepherd and you need to save your sheep from espacing the screen by drawing fences with an Apple Pencil (or with your finger).



**Longer**: The sheep will follow a Boids algorithm, which is an animal behaviour algorithm developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986. (More about it here ðŸ‘‰ https://eater.net/boids). Sometimes, weather will become rainy, and thunder will strike, making your sheep panick and run in a random direction. At the beginning, you have 30 sheep. The game ends when you lost all of them.
